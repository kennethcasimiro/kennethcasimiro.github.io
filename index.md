<img src="images/ngc.jpg?raw=true"/>
Interned for the CMN4 Software Team for the JSF F35.\
I applied technical knowledge to an agile oriented environment by translating user requirements into tasks related to designing, coding, and deplotment of a new capability for the F35.\
Additionally, I developed unit testing and code coverage to ensure code meets quality standards before being deployed.\
I also verified hardware components related to radio communications through electrical testing and analysis.\

<img src="images/lbnl.jpg?raw=true"/>
One of four students selected in the STEM Core program to intern at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I interned in the Computational Research Division for the Scientific Data Management (SDM) Group. \
My role in the SDM Group is to create and deploy continuous infrastructure components to several repositories from HPC-IO, a GitHub organization that contains various software tools that improve storing and accessing data (i.e., performing I/O) efficiently on high-performance computing (HPC) systems.\

[NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/)
<img src="images/jpl.jpg?raw=true"/>
Completed the Student Independent Research Intern (SIRI) program at NASA JPL for Spring 2021. I was able to gain educational experience in my field while also contributing to NASA and JPL missions and science. \
I interned for the Roman CGI Science Team where I was mentored by Dr. Marie Ygouf and Dr. Vanessa Bailey. \
My primary project was to develop image processing tools by performing tests on the most recent simulated data through Python for the Nancy Grace Roman Coronagraph Instrument (CGI).\
