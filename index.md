### Work Experience

[Northrop Grumman](https://www.northropgrumman.com/)
<img src="images/ngc.jpg?raw=true"/>
Interned for the CMN4 Software Team for the JSF F35.\
I applied technical knowledge to an agile oriented environment by translating user requirements into tasks related to designing, coding, and deplotment of a new capability for the F35.\
Additionally, I developed unit testing and code coverage to ensure code meets quality standards before being deployed.\
I also verified hardware components related to radio communications through electrical testing and analysis.

[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/)
<img src="images/lbnl.jpg?raw=true"/>
One of four students selected in the STEM Core program to intern at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I interned in the Computational Research Division for the Scientific Data Management (SDM) Group. \
My role in the SDM Group is to create and deploy continuous infrastructure components to several repositories from HPC-IO, a GitHub organization that contains various software tools that improve storing and accessing data (i.e., performing I/O) efficiently on high-performance computing (HPC) systems.

[NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/)
<img src="images/jpl.jpg?raw=true"/>
Completed the Student Independent Research Intern (SIRI) program at NASA JPL for Spring 2021. I was able to gain educational experience in my field while also contributing to NASA and JPL missions and science. \
I interned for the Roman CGI Science Team where I was mentored by Dr. Marie Ygouf and Dr. Vanessa Bailey. \
My primary project was to develop image processing tools by performing tests on the most recent simulated data through Python for the Nancy Grace Roman Coronagraph Instrument (CGI).

[Yonder Deep](https://yonderdeep.ucsd.edu/)

Yonder Deep aims to design and manufacture a 3D-printed underwater autonomous vehicle (AUV).  \
In collaboration with Dr. Grant Deane, we, a student-run STEM organization, are set to deploy on a mission in Svalbard, Norway in the summer of 2022. Our AUV will autonomously navigate to a glacier and dive to the terminus where it will record audio files of melting glaciers for Dr. Grant Deane’s research to determine the rate of rising sea levels. Our teams, which consist of mechanical, electrical, and software engineering fields, come together to continuously update new iterations of our AUV design. 

Was in the Electrical Team.
